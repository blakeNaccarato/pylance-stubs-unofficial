# pylance-stubs-unofficial

Contents of the `~\.vscode\extensions\ms-python.vscode-pylance-<RELEASE>\dist\bundled\stubs` directory for Pylance releases where `<RELEASE>` is a chronological version identifier like `YYYY-MM-##` where `##` is not the day.

This makes it possible to supply the stubs which are bundled behind-the-scenes in Pylance to CI/CD workflows running `pyright`.
